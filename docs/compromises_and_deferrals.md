## Fast test suite (2026-07-17, merged `c78c8b9`)

1. **Default suite runs the smallest canonical profile.**
   - What: `pytest` uses `CanonicalModelConfig.testing()` (21×21×4, nper=6);
     the 50×50 `validation` profile runs only in the weekly CI lane
     (`SIMPLE_MODFLOW_CANONICAL_PROFILE=validation`), the 100×100 full profile
     only manually.
   - Why: full suite 11m44s → 47.5s; every profile is contract-complete (all
     15 packages + 5 obs families), so *feature* coverage is unchanged.
   - Impact: day-to-day tests exercise smaller matrices; resolution-dependent
     numerical regressions would surface weekly, not per-push.
   - Revisit: if a bug ever slips through that validation() would have caught,
     promote validation to per-push CI.

2. **IES e2e tests trim the ensemble exploration.**
   - What: `run_ies(reals=6, iterations=1, lambda_scale_fac=1.0, workers=4)`
     in `tests/test_mf6_pest.py` (was the pyEMU defaults; ~82 forward runs →
     ~20).
   - Why: the two IES e2e tests dominated suite wall time (~270s combined).
   - Impact: tests still cover the full master/agent path, phi/ensemble
     mechanics, and review layer, but with one lambda scale factor and a
     small ensemble. The shipped `run_ies` API is untouched.
   - Revisit: weekly validation lane, or if an IES option-handling bug slips
     through.

3. **Pilot-point test density sized to the small domain.**
   - What: `pp_space=4` (was 8) in the pilot-point tests, keeping
     `n_pp >= 10` on the 2,100 m testing() domain.
   - Why/Impact: geometry-appropriate; sparser nets than production use.
   - Revisit: with any pilot-point algorithm change, re-run on validation().

4. **Large-multilayer render test shrunk.**
   - What: `test_interactive_plotting` large-multilayer cases now use
     nlay=4 / nper=6, mosaic `ncols=2`.
   - Why: rendering cost; the assertions still cover external frames, the
     1e30 dry-value mask, and NaN layers.
   - Impact: smaller frame payloads than the original stress shape.
   - Revisit: if an external-frames size threshold bug appears.

5. **Phase 4.5 second-tier splits deferred.**
   - What: splitting `grid/triangle.py` and `package_plotting.py` (the two
     remaining god-modules) postponed to Phase 8 prep.
   - Why: Phase 4's goal (import hygiene + the three worst modules) was met;
     recorded in the plan banner.
   - Revisit: Phase 8.

## Phase 5 — D8 / mf.riv / mf.evt (2026-07-17, branch `phase-5-package-api`)

> Entries 6, 13 and 14 below are now **scheduled** rather than open-ended: plan
> §4.7 (package declaration consolidation) absorbs them — 4.7.5 builds the
> `_ArealBuilder`/`EVTBuilder` (entry 6), 4.7.1 fixes `rch_spec` (13) and the
> budget/mover lists (14). They stay listed until the code actually lands.

6. **No `EVTBuilder` (no file-less whole-domain EVT form).**
   - What: `mf.evt` has `()` / `.gpkg` / `.flopy` but no builder form like
     `mf.rch(context=, nper=, recharge=)` that self-selects top-active cells.
   - Why: `RCHBuilder` broadcasts one value per cell; EVT needs a per-cell
     *elevation* (`surface`), which is new design surface, not reuse.
     `mf.evt.gpkg(..., surface=CellSurfaceOffset("cell_top"))` covers the
     areal land-surface case through the proven mapping engine.
   - Impact: whole-domain ET requires a domain-covering polygon or direct
     `stress_period_data`.
   - Revisit: on real user demand (recorded in plan §5.2 banner).

7. **EVT `.gpkg` emits only the `nseg=1` record shape.**
   - What: `GeoPackageSource.evt` maps `surface/rate/depth` (4-field records).
     Segmented ET (`nseg>1` with `pxdp`/`petm`/`petm0` values) works only via
     `()`/`.flopy` with explicitly assembled records.
   - Why: per-segment GeoPackage column conventions would be speculative API.
   - Impact: GIS-driven segmented ET is not one call.
   - UPDATE 2026-07-18 (post-review): the limit is now enforced, not implied —
     `GeoPackageSource.evt` raises a clear `ValueError` on `nseg != 1` instead
     of letting FloPy fail later with an opaque record-shape error, and the
     `.gpkg` docstring no longer advertises `nseg` as a usable option.
   - Revisit: if a real model needs segmented ET from GIS.

8. **RIV input hover is the generic per-field hover, not the sketched
   multi-field one.**
   - What: plan §5.1 sketched `cell_input_hover("stage",
     extra_fields=("cond", "rbot"))`; shipped the same generic per-field
     hover every other list BC uses (`inputs.stage.map()` hovers stage, etc.).
   - Why: no existing package passes `extra_fields`; a bespoke riv hover would
     have been the first, diverging from siblings for marginal value.
   - Impact: one field per input-map hover (consistent with chd/ghb/drn/wel).
   - Revisit: if multi-field input hover is wanted, add it for ALL list BCs
     at once, not riv alone.

9. ~~**RIV/EVT are not in the canonical model.**~~
   **RESOLVED 2026-07-18.** Both are now contract packages (13 → 15), so they
   run inside the full integration matrix (groups, diffs, PEST, parallel
   splits). Placement was chosen to avoid double-counting ET: **EVT sits on the
   valley walls alongside RCH** (the standard recharge/ET pairing) and is
   **disjoint from UZF**, which covers the floor and — verified — runs with
   `simulate_et` auto-enabled but no `linear_gwet`/`square_gwet`, i.e. vadose-zone
   ET only. **RIV is the un-routed outlet river below the lake** (xn 0.92–0.99),
   carved out of the UZF footprint exactly as the lake/stream cells are.
   Pinned by `test_canonical_evt_and_uzf_footprints_stay_disjoint` (mutation-tested:
   growing UZF onto the walls fails it) and
   `test_canonical_riv_and_evt_carry_real_flux`.

10. **RIV/EVT are not PEST `parameterize` targets.**
    - What: `cal.parameterize` supports `chd`/`ghb.cond`/`drn.cond`/`wel`
      etc., but not `riv.cond`/`riv.stage`/`evt.rate`.
    - Why: the parameterization backlog is plan §5.8; not silently in 5.1/5.2
      scope — listed here so the asymmetry with sibling BCs is visible.
    - Revisit: fold into §5.8 when it runs.

## Phase 5 adversarial review follow-up (2026-07-18)

An ultracode review of the D8/riv/evt diff confirmed 9 findings; all were fixed
(see the review-fixes commit). The residue below is what was deliberately NOT
done, plus one assurance gap in the review itself.

12. ~~**The review that vetted this work was only ~50% complete.**~~
    **RESOLVED 2026-07-18** — review re-run to completion (18/18 agents,
    worktree-isolated; 4 confirmed of 14 claims). The **budget off-by-one is now
    FIXED** (commit below): it was worse than reported — `model.bud()` returned
    1-based nodes for **chd, riv, wel AND evt** (chd/wel predate riv/evt by
    years), while `group.bud('drn'|'ghb')` came back one cell low. Both halves
    were fixed together as required. **All four confirmed findings are now
    closed** (2026-07-18): the budget pair, plus `default_input` pinning (now
    table-driven over the registry's `cell_stress` set) and the
    `_PackageDiffNamespace` riv/evt properties. Nothing outstanding from this
    review; entry kept as the record of what it found. Delete at the next
    ledger tidy.

13. ~~**`rch_spec` keeps the fragile `maxbound` inference.**~~
    **RESOLVED 2026-07-18** — removed, matching `evt_spec` and every other list
    BC. Verified behavior-preserving: FloPy computes `MAXBOUND` at write time and
    the written `.rch` file is byte-identical (`MAXBOUND 3` for a 3-record
    period). `test_list_bc_specs_accept_every_native_flopy_input_shape` now
    covers all 7 list BCs against a bare list, a `None` period, and an empty
    dict, and asserts none of them pre-compute `maxbound`.

14. **`_MOVER_PACKAGES` still lists `rch`, which has no mover support.**
    - What: added `riv` (FloPy confirms `mover=True`); left the pre-existing
      `rch` entry, which FloPy shows has no `mover` option.
    - Why: harmless — the budget-term lookup is `try`-wrapped and finds
      nothing — and removing it is an out-of-scope behavior change.
    - Revisit: whenever the mover diff is next touched.

15. **RIV/EVT input maps hover one field at a time (unchanged from entry 8).**
    - Confirmed still true post-review; the generic per-field hover is what all
      list BCs use. Not a regression, just not the plan's sketch.

16. **Mutation-testing residue is a real process hazard.**
    - What: the review's test-quality agents mutated `package_api.py` and
      `advanced.py` in the shared working tree and did not revert. One verifier
      then read the mutated tree and reported a false defect ("nseg forward
      deleted") as fact.
    - Why: workflow agents ran without `isolation: "worktree"`.
    - Impact: none persisted (mutations were uncommitted and reverted), but a
      review verdict was contaminated, and a careless `git restore` during
      cleanup briefly wiped uncommitted fixes.
    - Revisit: run review workflows that may mutate code with
      `isolation: "worktree"`, and always `git status` before trusting a
      subagent's file-based claim.

## Notebook session-state call (2026-07-17, `c578b53`)

11. **`RUN_SUITE` restored to `False` in `canonical_fast_tour.ipynb`.**
    - What: the user's session had flipped it to `True`; the commit keeps
      their three `.show()` edits but restores the documented `False` gate
      default and strips executed outputs (D2).
    - Why: `True` as the checked-in default would make every fresh notebook
      run launch the full pytest suite; judged to be leftover session state.
    - Impact: none if the judgment was right; user was flagged and can flip
      it back if `True` was intended.
    - Revisit: user says so.
