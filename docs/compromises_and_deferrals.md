## Fast test suite (2026-07-17, merged `c78c8b9`)

1. **Default suite runs the smallest canonical profile.**
   - What: `pytest` uses `CanonicalModelConfig.testing()` (21×21×4, nper=6);
     the 50×50 `validation` profile runs only in the weekly CI lane
     (`SIMPLE_MODFLOW_CANONICAL_PROFILE=validation`), the 100×100 full profile
     only manually.
   - Why: full suite 11m44s → 47.5s; every profile is contract-complete (all
     13 packages + 5 obs families), so *feature* coverage is unchanged.
   - Impact: day-to-day tests exercise smaller matrices; resolution-dependent
     numerical regressions would surface weekly, not per-push.
   - Revisit: if a bug ever slips through that validation() would have caught,
     promote validation to per-push CI.

2. **IES e2e tests trim the ensemble exploration.**
   - What: `run_ies(reals=6, iterations=1, lambda_scale_fac=1.0, workers=4)`
     in `tests/test_mf6_pest.py` (was the pyEMU defaults; ~82 forward runs →
     ~20).
   - Why: the two IES e2e tests dominated suite wall time (~270s combined).
   - Impact: tests still cover the full master/agent path, phi/ensemble
     mechanics, and review layer, but with one lambda scale factor and a
     small ensemble. The shipped `run_ies` API is untouched.
   - Revisit: weekly validation lane, or if an IES option-handling bug slips
     through.

3. **Pilot-point test density sized to the small domain.**
   - What: `pp_space=4` (was 8) in the pilot-point tests, keeping
     `n_pp >= 10` on the 2,100 m testing() domain.
   - Why/Impact: geometry-appropriate; sparser nets than production use.
   - Revisit: with any pilot-point algorithm change, re-run on validation().

4. **Large-multilayer render test shrunk.**
   - What: `test_interactive_plotting` large-multilayer cases now use
     nlay=4 / nper=6, mosaic `ncols=2`.
   - Why: rendering cost; the assertions still cover external frames, the
     1e30 dry-value mask, and NaN layers.
   - Impact: smaller frame payloads than the original stress shape.
   - Revisit: if an external-frames size threshold bug appears.

5. **Phase 4.5 second-tier splits deferred.**
   - What: splitting `grid/triangle.py` and `package_plotting.py` (the two
     remaining god-modules) postponed to Phase 8 prep.
   - Why: Phase 4's goal (import hygiene + the three worst modules) was met;
     recorded in the plan banner.
   - Revisit: Phase 8.

## Phase 5 — D8 / mf.riv / mf.evt (2026-07-17, branch `phase-5-package-api`)

6. **No `EVTBuilder` (no file-less whole-domain EVT form).**
   - What: `mf.evt` has `()` / `.gpkg` / `.flopy` but no builder form like
     `mf.rch(context=, nper=, recharge=)` that self-selects top-active cells.
   - Why: `RCHBuilder` broadcasts one value per cell; EVT needs a per-cell
     *elevation* (`surface`), which is new design surface, not reuse.
     `mf.evt.gpkg(..., surface=CellSurfaceOffset("cell_top"))` covers the
     areal land-surface case through the proven mapping engine.
   - Impact: whole-domain ET requires a domain-covering polygon or direct
     `stress_period_data`.
   - Revisit: on real user demand (recorded in plan §5.2 banner).

7. **EVT `.gpkg` emits only the `nseg=1` record shape.**
   - What: `GeoPackageSource.evt` maps `surface/rate/depth` (4-field records).
     Segmented ET (`nseg>1` with `pxdp`/`petm`/`petm0` values) works only via
     `()`/`.flopy` with explicitly assembled records.
   - Why: per-segment GeoPackage column conventions would be speculative API.
   - Impact: GIS-driven segmented ET is not one call.
   - Revisit: if a real model needs segmented ET from GIS.

8. **RIV input hover is the generic per-field hover, not the sketched
   multi-field one.**
   - What: plan §5.1 sketched `cell_input_hover("stage",
     extra_fields=("cond", "rbot"))`; shipped the same generic per-field
     hover every other list BC uses (`inputs.stage.map()` hovers stage, etc.).
   - Why: no existing package passes `extra_fields`; a bespoke riv hover would
     have been the first, diverging from siblings for marginal value.
   - Impact: one field per input-map hover (consistent with chd/ghb/drn/wel).
   - Revisit: if multi-field input hover is wanted, add it for ALL list BCs
     at once, not riv alone.

9. **RIV/EVT are not in the canonical model.**
   - What: the canonical valley model (and its 13-package contract) was not
     extended; riv/evt e2e coverage lives in
     `test_geopackage_specs_run_through_project` (small 2-cell MF6 run with
     explorer/colorscale assertions).
   - Why: touching the canonical contract ripples through every profile,
     fixture, notebook, and the parallel-split/PEST suites — out of proportion
     for two list BCs whose machinery is shared with proven siblings.
   - Impact: riv/evt never run inside the big integration matrix (groups,
     diffs, PEST, splits all exercise the canonical model only).
   - Revisit: if riv/evt-specific integration bugs appear, or at the next
     deliberate canonical-contract revision.

10. **RIV/EVT are not PEST `parameterize` targets.**
    - What: `cal.parameterize` supports `chd`/`ghb.cond`/`drn.cond`/`wel`
      etc., but not `riv.cond`/`riv.stage`/`evt.rate`.
    - Why: the parameterization backlog is plan §5.8; not silently in 5.1/5.2
      scope — listed here so the asymmetry with sibling BCs is visible.
    - Revisit: fold into §5.8 when it runs.

## Notebook session-state call (2026-07-17, `c578b53`)

11. **`RUN_SUITE` restored to `False` in `canonical_fast_tour.ipynb`.**
    - What: the user's session had flipped it to `True`; the commit keeps
      their three `.show()` edits but restores the documented `False` gate
      default and strips executed outputs (D2).
    - Why: `True` as the checked-in default would make every fresh notebook
      run launch the full pytest suite; judged to be leftover session state.
    - Impact: none if the judgment was right; user was flagged and can flip
      it back if `True` was intended.
    - Revisit: user says so.
